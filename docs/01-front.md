## Front

To get started with Apexo Application you need to have the application installed on your system. Apexo is a progressive web application, meaning that it uses the web and the browser as a platform to run on any device. That doesn't mean that you can't run it when being offline, nor it means that you can't install it as an executable on your system.

Use any of the following options to setup the front of your application:

### Without installation

Without any installation what so ever, you can use any modern browser (Chrome, edge, firefox, safari) to navigate to [web.apexo.app](https://web.apexo.app) and just as the website loads it will be installed on your computer i.e. you can navigate to it while offline and it won't require internet connection anymore.

Using this option will provide with the latest updates and bugfixes just as they get released.
